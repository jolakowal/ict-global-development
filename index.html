Through interactive sessions and immersive discussions participants will delve into the transformative potential of ICT interventions and social entrepreneurship initiatives in economically developing regions.</p>
            <p>Key themes include fostering cross-sector partnerships leveraging emerging technologies for social impact and designing sustainable business models that prioritize equitable access to digital resources. By harnessing the collective expertise and passion of our diverse community we aspire to co-create actionable strategies that drive positive change and elevate lives worldwide.</p>

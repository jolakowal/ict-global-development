Our SIG GLOBDEV Official Ancillary Meeting 2024 and Pre-AMCIS 2024 Workshop SIG titled "BRIDGING HORIZONS: EMPOWERING GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH ICT AND SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP" is devoted to issues described below.

In an era marked by digital disparities and burgeoning social entrepreneurship our workshop aims to forge new pathways toward inclusive growth and societal advancement. Grounded in the ethos of SIG GLOBDEV and the visionary landscape of AMCIS 2024 our workshop seeks to explore the synergies between ICT and social entrepreneurship in addressing the pressing challenges of global poverty and digital equity.

Drawing an inspiration from the rich history of innovation and humanitarian outreach our workshop endeavors to catalyze a meaningful dialogue and collaborative action. Through interactive sessions and immersive discussions participants will delve into the transformative potential of ICT interventions and social entrepreneurship initiatives in economically developing regions.

Key themes include fostering cross-sector partnerships leveraging emerging technologies for social impact and designing sustainable business models that prioritize equitable access to digital resources. By harnessing the collective expertise and passion of our diverse community we aspire to co-create actionable strategies that drive positive change and elevate lives worldwide.

Join us on a journey of exploration and empowerment as we chart a course toward a more inclusive and socially conscious digital future. Together let us bridge horizons and pave the way for a world where technology serves as a catalyst for prosperity and social justice.
